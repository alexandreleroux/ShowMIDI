## Purpose

This application fills a void in the avaiable MIDI monitoring solutions.

Instead of wading through logs of MIDI messages to correlate relevant ones and identify what is happening, ShowMIDI visualizes the current activity and hides what you don't care about anymore. It provides you with a real-time glanceable view of all MIDI activatity on your computer.

## Download

You can download pre-built binaries from the release section:

If you're using the macOS Homebrew package manager, you can install ShowMIDI with:

brew install gbevin/tools/showmidi
```
